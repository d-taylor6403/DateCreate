## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project [Date Create ](https://github.com/habibtaghavi08/DateCreate) up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need:

```
Open your Code editing software (example Visual Studio)

Open the "Terminal" in studio
perform a git clone https://github.com/habibtaghavi08/DateCreate.git
```

### Installing

After having the files cloned into your Studio, I would perform a 
* "Save Workspace AS" to have a workspace to come back to.
* Next you will need to install your code's Dependencies
    * This will capture all the items in your package.json file

See below on how to perform the install.

```


```

## Running the server

Now you will want to run the web site locally.

### Right Click your server.js file and OPEN in Terminal

This will open your terminal in your "Root" folder and allow you to run the server "you may have done this already to get your  "npm i " completed

```
npm start or yarn start
```

### You should now see the serving running

With this react application it should start automatically, so wait for the lines below to show.
